# How it works, what it's for and how to debug it: .claude/EMULATOR.md. Run it INSIDE the sandbox.
# The emulator, the system image and the virtual device are baked into the image (sandbox/Dockerfile), so
# `start` just boots it (~20 s). If one is missing - a container from an image built before they were
# added, or another EMULATOR_API - `start` installs it first (~1.5 GB, and only for that container).
#
# Two things here are not obvious, and both are why this script exists rather than a one-line command:
#
# - /dev/kvm is root:<the host's kvm gid> inside the container and `dev` isn't in that group, so without
#   a fix the emulator falls back to software CPU emulation, far too slow to drive an app. The sandbox is
#   --privileged and `dev` has passwordless sudo, so the device node is opened up (this container's copy
#   only - the host's is untouched).
# - The emulator's software GLES path (gfxstream + SwiftShader) segfaults in its render thread while
#   drawing DiceFive, silently killing the emulator (exit status 139, no crash report) a few seconds
#   after the app opens - it shows up as `adb: device offline`. Its Vulkan path doesn't, so the app's UI
#   renderer is switched to Vulkan after boot (debug.hwui.renderer=skiavk, which resets on every boot, so
#   this script sets it every time). The app draws correctly under it.

# EMULATOR_API comes from the image (sandbox/Dockerfile ENV), where it is chosen - it follows compileSdk - and
# the value here is only the fallback for a shell without it. The dependency update script keeps the two in
